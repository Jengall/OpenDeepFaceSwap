Pushing PRs to https://github.com/deepfakes/faceswap is too hard. 
Its like fight for every PR. 
People vote against improvements.

So I decided to create global refactoring of faceswap for myself with new features, where also removed most of useless suxx things, which was added last month in original repo.

This fork tested only in Windows. If you can test on Linux - you are welcome.

Requirements with dlib: version 19.10
